# Weather Journal App - Front End Nano Degree @Udacity

1. **Author**

The weather journal app has been created by Hasan Osman for the third project required by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) on its [Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011#batBeacon848153944116)

2. **Project Background**

The aim of the project is to build an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.

3. **Projecct Use**

The user enters his/her location by typing the name of his/her city and how he/she is feeling at that time and the app responds by giving back the temperature of his/her location, the date, and his/her feelings which were entered by the user.

4. **Project Requirements**

The bulk of the code is written in two files: server.js and website/app.js. It is required that a Node and Express project environment is set up which includes:

- creating a server on the port of our choice,
- adding a GET route that returns the projectData object in the server code,
- acquiring API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website,
- chaining a Promise that makes a POST request to add the API data, as well as data entered by the user, to the app, and
- chaining another Promise that updates the UI dynamically.
  I did not make any changes to the styling of the app except for colour scheme of the app.
